# Log Analysis Scripts Explanation

## Script 1: Count Unique IPs in Log File

### Purpose
This script is designed to read a log file and identify unique IP addresses present in the log. It also counts the total number of lines in the log file.

### How It Works
1. The script reads a log file line by line.
2. It uses regular expressions to find IP addresses in each line.
3. Unique IP addresses are stored in a set.
4. The script returns the set of unique IPs and the total count of lines in the log file.
5. It saves the unique IP addresses to a file named 'unique_ips.txt'.
6. Finally, it prints the total count of IPs and the number of unique IPs found.

## Script 2: Filter Log by IP and Status Code

### Purpose
This script filters log entries based on a specific attacker IP address and status code. It helps identify log entries related to a particular attacker and status code.

### How It Works
1. The script reads a log file line by line.
2. It uses regular expressions to find IP addresses and status codes in each line.
3. It compares the IP address and status code to the provided attacker IP and status code.
4. If a match is found, the line is added to the list of filtered lines.
5. The script returns the filtered log entries for the specified attacker IP and status code.
6. It prints the filtered log entries to the console.

### Usage
- Ensure the log file paths are correctly specified in the scripts.
- Run the scripts with Python to analyze the log files as per the described functionalities.

Feel free to modify and use these scripts for your log analysis tasks!
